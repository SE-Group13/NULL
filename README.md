### Pet minder App 

The Pet Minder application is designed to connect pet owners with pet minders, providing a hub for pet care services. The platform enables pet owners to search for minders based on various criteria, including ratings, testimonials, location, and availability. Likewise, minders can also search for pet owners seeking their services based on the same criteria.

With Pet Minder, pet owners can provide specific instructions to their minders, such as preferred walking routes, feeding schedules, and other pet care needs. Minders can track pets during walks or other activities, giving pet owners peace of mind knowing their pets are in good hands.

By offering a central platform for pet care services, Pet Minder aims to simplify the process of finding a trusted pet minder, and to provide an easy-to-use platform that streamlines communication between pet owners and minders.
