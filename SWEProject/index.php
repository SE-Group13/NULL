                            We were very nervous using a house sitter for the first time especially as we have a ‘broken’ rescue dog that’s very scared. 
                            However after meeting Julie-Ann and Nick, we felt reassured and confident enough to enjoy our holiday break. 
                            Absolutely no regrets. The dogs loved them and we were kept updated often. Highly recommended.

                            Extremely professional, always on top of everything. Very accurate in administering meds to our pups and she even performed some

                            Thanks to her we managed to enjoy without worrying for our dogs.

                            Louise was excellent at making sure our kitties got the attention and care they needed twice daily while we were away. 
                            Louise also went the extra mile in letting us know about some cheeky construction workers making a mess in front of our house- 
                            which provided us the opportunity to address the matter with our neighbors in a timely fashion, preventing damage to our property. 
                            Highly recommend. Thank you, Louise!
